# Booker

This app is built using SwiftUI. 

This app helps a user keep track of the books that he/she is reading. The user can add any book, give any rating, set the status of the book as completed, planning to read, in progressor or on hold. 
There are also other details that a user can fill in like the author of the book, the number of pages and the genre of the book. 

The home screen of the app shows a list of books added by the user and grouped by the author name.
There is also a genre tab which displays books grouped by genre of the books. The user can drill down into any of the books through the home screen or the genre screen and can edit the book details.
